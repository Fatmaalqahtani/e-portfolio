								<h2>Collaborative Discussion Forum Summaries</h2>
								<p style="text-align: justify">The discussions in the collaborative forums provided rich insights into research methods and ethical considerations in computing.
									<br><br>In Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods, The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing, I participated in a discussion in Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 on "Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct," where we analyzed a case study titled "Automatic Active Response Weaponry" (ACM, N.D.). This experience highlighted the significance of ethical standards in the computing profession and underscored the impact of ethical decision-making on legal and social issues. Through our analysis, we explored how the transition from passive protective systems to aggressive technologies raises concerns about public safety and accountability. This discussion prompted a critical examination of the implications of algorithmic decision-making, particularly regarding human rights and data protection laws, such as GDPR (2016). Furthermore, we considered the role of whistleblowers and the necessity for companies to cultivate a culture of ethical transparency. Engaging in this dialogue deepened my understanding of how ethical frameworks can guide the development and implementation of technologies, ensuring they serve the public interest.
									<br><br>In Unit 7: Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing, I engaged in a case study in Collaborative Learning Discussion 2 that involved a researcher named Abi, who faced ethical dilemmas while analyzing the nutritional value of a new cereal. This discussion deepened my understanding of the responsibility researchers hold in presenting data accurately and transparently, especially when faced with conflicting interests. We collectively navigated the complexities of data integrity and the ethical obligations that accompany research. Analyzing Abi's dilemma underscored the critical need for transparency in reporting results and the importance of adhering to established research methodologies. The discussion also emphasized the potential ramifications of misrepresenting research findings, both for public health and corporate credibility. We examined the ethical frameworks surrounding whistleblowing and how they empower researchers to prioritize the public good over corporate loyalty, illuminating the nuanced nature of ethical decision-making in research.
									Additionally, these collaborative exercises enhanced my appreciation for effective communication and teamwork. Engaging with peers from diverse backgrounds allowed me to consider multiple perspectives, challenging my preconceptions and promoting a more holistic approach to problem-solving. Through the exchange of ideas, I gained insights into how ethical dilemmas are approached in different cultural and organizational contexts, broadening my understanding of the implications of ethical decision-making in research and practice. Overall, these discussions emphasized the importance of ethical integrity and interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing complex challenges within the field of computing.

								<h2>Professional Development Aspect and Summary of Learning Outcomes</h2>
								<p style="text-align: justify" >My journey through this module has been transformative, significantly enhancing my analytical and practical skills in research methods and professional practice. I have learned not only to identify and analyze complex problems effectively but also to develop strategic, ethical responses to various challenges. This experience has instilled in me a deeper appreciation for the interdisciplinary nature of research and its applications in professional contexts. It has highlighted the importance of collaboration and holistic thinking in addressing complex issues, emphasizing ethical considerations in computing. Through continuous learning and application, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to the evolving landscape of technology and research.</p>
